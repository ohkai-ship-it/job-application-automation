# README for database files
# This directory is git-ignored to prevent:
# - Committing production application data (applications.db)
# - Committing test artifacts (applications_dev.db, applications_test.db)
#
# Database files created by the application:
# - applications.db        (production: real job applications)
# - applications_dev.db    (development: for testing code changes)
# - applications_test.db   (testing: isolated for pytest)
#
# To migrate production data from Trello:
# 1. Set APP_ENV=production
# 2. Run: python scripts/import_trello_to_db.py
# 3. This creates applications.db with all Trello card data
#
# For development and testing:
# - applications_dev.db is your safe playground
# - applications_test.db is auto-managed by pytest
