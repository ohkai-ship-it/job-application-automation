│   ├── screenshots/             # UI, Trello cards, DOCX
│   ├── sample_data/             # Sanitized job data
│   └── demo_video.mp4           # Workflow demonstration
└── .portfolio_gitignore         # What to exclude for public
```

### Phase 2: Portfolio Website Integration (Week 2)
**Goal:** Deep dive for interested recruiters/hiring managers

**Page Structure:**
1. **Hero**: Problem → Solution → Impact (5-second hook)
2. **Demo**: Interactive or video walkthrough
3. **Technical Deep Dive**: Architecture, decisions, trade-offs
4. **Results**: Metrics, time savings, cost analysis
5. **Code Quality**: Testing, documentation, best practices
6. **Lessons Learned**: Growth mindset, future improvements
7. **Open Source**: Link to GitHub, collaboration invitation

### Phase 3: Content Marketing (Week 3-4)
**Platforms:**
- **Blog Post**: "How I Automated My Job Search with AI" (Medium/Dev.to)
- **LinkedIn Article**: "Reducing Job Application Time by 93% with Python"
- **Reddit**: r/Python, r/cscareerquestions, r/jobsearchhacks
- **HackerNews**: Technical implementation discussion

## Dual-Purpose Considerations

### Production System Requirements:
- ✅ Reliable duplicate detection (active use)
- ✅ Cost tracking (budget management)
- ✅ Error handling (workflow continuity)
- ✅ Backup/restore (data protection)
- 🎯 LinkedIn integration (expand job sources)
- 🎯 Multi-AI providers (cost optimization)

### Portfolio Showcase Requirements:
- ✅ Clean code architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Visual demonstrations
- ✅ Metrics and impact data
- 🎯 Public demo environment
- 🎯 Technical blog content

### Synergies:
- Production use validates the system works
- Real metrics provide authentic impact data
- Ongoing development shows commitment to quality
- Real-world constraints demonstrate engineering judgment

## Next Steps: LinkedIn Integration Priority

Given the dual-purpose nature, **LinkedIn integration is the highest-value next feature**:

### Production Benefits:
- **2x Job Sources**: Stepstone + LinkedIn = comprehensive coverage
- **Better Opportunities**: LinkedIn often has exclusive/early postings
- **Network Leverage**: Detect connections at target companies
- **Market Intelligence**: Salary ranges, company insights

### Portfolio Benefits:
- **Technical Complexity**: Browser automation, anti-detection
- **API Integration**: Multiple platform handling
- **Scaling Challenges**: Rate limiting, session management
- **Real-World Constraints**: Legal/ethical considerations

**This makes LinkedIn integration perfect for both production use AND portfolio storytelling.**
